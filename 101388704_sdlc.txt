Learning DevOps engineering is important in the software
development life cycle (SDLC) because it helps bridge 
the gap between development and operations teams.
Traditionally, developers focused on writing code while 
operations handled deployment and maintenance, 
which often caused delays, errors, and miscommunication. 
DevOps promotes collaboration, shared responsibility, and
continuous feedback throughout every stage of the SDLC.
