Learning DevOps engineering is important in the software
development life cycle (SDLC) because it helps bridge 
the gap between development and operations teams.
Traditionally, developers focused on writing code while 
operations handled deployment and maintenance, 
which often caused delays, errors, and miscommunication. 
DevOps promotes collaboration, shared responsibility, and
continuous feedback throughout every stage of the SDLC.

DevOps practices such as continuous integration, 
continuous deployment (CI/CD), automation, and monitoring
allow software to be built, tested, and released faster 
and more reliably. This reduces manual errors, 
improves software quality, and enables teams to detect 
and fix issues earlier in the development process. 
As a result, organizations can deliver updates more 
frequently while maintaining system stability.

In addition, learning DevOps prepares engineers to work
with modern tools and cloud-based environments that are 
widely used in the industry.
