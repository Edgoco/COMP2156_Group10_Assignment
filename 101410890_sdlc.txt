DevOps helps teams build, test, and release software faster by automating
repetitive tasks like building code, testing, and deployment. This reduces 
delays and allows companies to deliver updates quickly.

DevOps connects developers and IT operations teams, encouraging communication 
and shared responsibility. Instead of working separately, teams collaborate 
throughout the entire SDLC.



The End.
